# Book Store. Collections

The purpose of this exercise is to check your knowledge of the Java collections framework and your ability to use it on practical tasks.

Duration: **1** hour


## Description

In this exercise, you will implement "Book Store" to allow users to filter and sort books and information about orders in a variety of ways.
The class diagram of the Domain model is shown in the figure below:

You are also given a description of the following interfaces and class:
* The `Sort` interface allows books to be sorted by published year, price(in descending order) and orders to be sorted by clientId.
* The `Find` interface allows users to search for and filter books and orders based on various criteria.
* The `Add` interface allows books and orders to be added.
* The `Store` class determines the functionality of the book store.


First, proceed to the Domain model classes and implement their content.

Then, proceed to the `Store` class, which contains lists of the `Book` objects and the `Order` objects, and also implements the `Sort`,`Find` and `Add` interfaces. 
You need to implement the following methods of the `Store` class:


* `public void addBook(Book book)`  
   Adds a book to the list of books

* `public void addOrder(Order order)`  
   Adds an order to the list of orders

* `Set<String> findAuthors()`  
   Returns a set of the authors

* `Map<String, List<Order>> findOrdersGroupedByClientId()`  
   Returns a map in which the key is the clientId, and the value is a list of the orders of selected client that the store has

* `List<String> findMostPopularAuthors()`  
   Calculates how much times each books of the author in the fleet has been ordered and then return the list of authors which has the greatest numbers of orders 

* `List<Book> findBooksWhichPublishedAfterSelectedDate(LocalDate date)`  
   Returns a list of books whose published date is after the date parameter

* `List<Book> findBooksInPriceRange(BigDecimal min, BigDecimal max)`  
   Returns a list of books whose price within a range provided by min and max parameters

* `Set<Client> findClientsWithAveragePriceNoLessThan(List<Client> clients, int average)`  
   Calculates the average number of orders for each client and returns a set of clients whose average order amount is not less than the average

* `Set<Order> findOrdersByDate(LocalDateTime dateTime)`  
  Returns a set of orders that has the same orderDate as the dateTime parameter

* `List<Book> sortOrdersByClientId()`  
  Returns all orders sorted by clientId as a new list

* `List<Book> sortBooksByPublishedYear()`  
  Returns all books sorted by year of publishing as a new list

* `List<Book> sortBooksByPriceDesc()`  
  Returns all books sorted by price as a new list in desc order

### Restrictions

You may not use lambda expressions or streams.
